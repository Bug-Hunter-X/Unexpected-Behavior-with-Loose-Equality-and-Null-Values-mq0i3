# JavaScript Null Value Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript related to handling null values and the use of loose equality (==).  The `bug.js` file contains code exhibiting this issue, while `bugSolution.js` presents a corrected version.

Loose equality can lead to unexpected type coercion.  Explicitly checking for null using strict equality (===) prevents such issues, ensuring cleaner and more reliable code.
